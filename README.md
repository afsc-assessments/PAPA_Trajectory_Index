# PAPA_Trajectory_Index

Repo for PAPA Trajectory Index code and results.

## Introduction

The PAPA Trajectory Index provides an annual index reflecting broad-scale circulation in the northeast Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Alaska based on the 
end location of a simulated surface drifter released on December 1 and tracked for 90 days (i.e., ending on February 29 or March 1 of the subsequent year,
dependent on whether the ending year is a leap year or not).
